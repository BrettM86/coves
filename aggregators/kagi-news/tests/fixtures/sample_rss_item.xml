  <description>&lt;p&gt;The White House confirmed President Trump will hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 30, at the end of an Asia trip that includes Malaysia and Japan . The administration said the meeting will take place Thursday morning local time, and Mr Trump indicated his first question to Xi would concern fentanyl and other bilateral issues . The talks come amid heightened trade tensions after Beijing expanded export curbs on rare-earth minerals and following Mr Trump's recent threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods, making the meeting a focal point for discussions on trade, technology supply chains and energy .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Q2SRXQtwTYBIiQeI0FG-X6taF_wHSJaXDiFUzju2kbCWGuOYIFUX--8L0BqE4VKxpbOJY3ylFPJkDpfSnyQYZ1qdOLXbphHTnsOK4jb7gqC4KCn5nf3ANbWCuaFD5ZUSijiK0k7wOLP2fyX6tynu2mPtXlCbotLo2lTrEswZl4-No2AI4mI4lkResfnRdp-YjpoEfCOHkNfbN1-0cNcHt9T2dmgBSXrQ2w' alt='News image associated with coverage of President Trump&amp;#x27;s Asia trip and planned meeting with President Xi' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Highlights:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Itinerary details: The Asia swing begins in Malaysia, continues to Japan and ends with the bilateral meeting in South Korea on Thursday morning local time, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;APEC context: US officials indicated the leaders will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering, shaping expectations for short, high-level talks rather than a lengthy summit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff escalation: President Trump recently threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting in November, a step he has described as unsustainable but that has heightened urgency for talks .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rare-earth impact: Beijing's expanded curbs on rare-earth exports have exposed supply vulnerabilities because US high-tech firms rely heavily on those materials, raising strategic and economic stakes for the meeting .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Work out a lot of our doubts and questions - President Trump&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Perspectives:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;President Trump: He said his first question to President Xi would be about fentanyl and indicated he hoped to resolve bilateral doubts and questions in the talks.
