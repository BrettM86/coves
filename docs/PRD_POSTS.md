## Overview

Posts are the core content unit in Coves communities. Built on atProto, each post is stored in the **community's repository** and indexed by the AppView for discovery and interaction. Posts support rich text, embeds, voting, tagging, and federation with other atProto platforms.

## Architecture

### atProto Data Flow
Posts follow the community-owned repository pattern, matching the V2 Communities architecture:

```
User creates post → Written to COMMUNITY's PDS repository (using community credentials) →
Firehose broadcasts event → AppView Jetstream consumer indexes →
Post appears in feeds
```

**Repository Structure:**
```
Repository:  at://did:plc:community789/social.coves.community.post.record/3k2a4b5c6d7e
Owner:       did:plc:community789 (community owns the post)
Author:      did:plc:user123 (tracked in record metadata)
Hosted By:   did:web:coves.social (instance manages community credentials)
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- ✅ Communities own posts (posts live in community repos, like traditional forums)
- ✅ Author tracked in metadata (post.author field references user DID)
- ✅ Communities are portable (migrate instance = posts move with community)
- ✅ Matches V2 Communities pattern (community owns repository, instance manages credentials)
- ✅ Write operations use community's PDS credentials (not user credentials)

## Alpha Features (MVP - Ship First)

### Content Rules Integration
**Status:** Lexicon complete (2025-10-18), validation TODO
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Required for community content policies

Posts are validated against community-specific content rules at creation time. Communities can restrict:
- Allowed embed types (images, video, external, record)
- Text requirements (min/max length, required/optional)
- Title requirements
- Image count limits
- Federated content policies

**See:** [PRD_GOVERNANCE.md - Content Rules System](PRD_GOVERNANCE.md#content-rules-system) for full details.

**Implementation checklist:**
- [x] Lexicon: `contentRules` in `social.coves.community.profile` ✅
- [x] Lexicon: `postType` removed from `social.coves.community.post.create` ✅
- [ ] Validation: `ValidatePostAgainstRules()` service function
- [ ] Handler: Integrate validation in post creation endpoint
- [ ] AppView: Index derived characteristics (embed_type, text_length, etc.)
- [ ] Tests: Validate content rule enforcement

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-10-18: Content Rules Over Post Type Enum
**Decision:** Remove `postType` from post creation input; validate posts against community's `contentRules` instead

**Rationale:**
- `postType` enum forced users to explicitly select type (bad UX - app should infer from structure)
- Structure-based validation is more flexible ("text required, images optional" vs rigid type categories)
- Content rules are extensible without changing post lexicon
- Enables both community restrictions (governance) AND user filtering (UI preferences)
- Follows atProto philosophy: describe data structure, not UI intent

**Implementation:**
- Post creation no longer accepts `postType` parameter
- Community profile contains optional `contentRules` object
- Handler validates post structure against community's content rules
- AppView indexes derived characteristics (embed_type, text_length, has_title, has_embed)
- Validation error changed from `InvalidPostType` to `ContentRuleViolation`

**Database Changes:**
- Remove `post_type` enum column
- Add derived fields: `embed_type`, `text_length`, `has_title`, `has_embed`
- Add index on `embed_type` for filtering

**Example Rules:**
- Text-only community: `allowedEmbedTypes: []` + `requireText: true`
- Image community: `allowedEmbedTypes: ["images"]` + `minImages: 1`
- No restrictions: `contentRules: null`

**See:** [PRD_GOVERNANCE.md - Content Rules System](PRD_GOVERNANCE.md#content-rules-system)

---

### 2025-10-18: Posts Live in Community Repositories
**Decision:** Posts are stored in community's repository, not user's repository

**Rationale:**
- **Matches V2 Communities Architecture:** Communities own their repositories
- **Traditional Forum Model:** Community owns content, author tracked in metadata
- **Simpler Permissions:** Use community credentials for all post writes
- **Portability:** Posts migrate with community when changing instances
- **Moderation:** Community has full control over content
- **Reuses Token Refresh:** Can leverage existing community credential management

**Implementation Details:**
- Post AT-URI: `at://community_did/social.coves.community.post.record/tid`
- Write operations use community's PDS credentials (encrypted, stored in AppView)
- Author tracked in post record's `author` field (DID)
- Moderators can delete any post in their community
- Token refresh reuses community's refresh logic

**Trade-offs vs User-Owned Posts:**
- ❌ Users can't take posts when leaving community/instance
- ❌ Less "web3" (content not user-owned)
- ✅ Traditional forum UX (users expect community to own content)
- ✅ Simpler implementation (one credential store per community)
- ✅ Easier moderation (community has full control)
- ✅ Posts move with community during migration

**Comparison to Bluesky:**
- Bluesky: Users own posts (posts in user repo)
- Coves: Communities own posts (posts in community repo)
- This is acceptable - different platforms, different models
- Still atProto-compliant (just different ownership pattern)

---

### 2025-10-18: Votes Live in User Repositories
**Decision:** Vote records are stored in user's repository, not community's

**Rationale:**
- Users own their voting history (personal preference)
- Matches Bluesky pattern (likes in user's repo)
- Enables portable voting history across instances
- User controls their own voting record

**Implementation Details:**
- Vote AT-URI: `at://user_did/social.coves.interaction.vote/tid`
- Write operations use user's PDS credentials
- Subject field references post AT-URI (in community's repo)
- Consumer aggregates votes from all users into post stats

---

### 2025-10-18: Simplify Post Types for Alpha
**Decision:** Launch with text posts only, defer other embed types to Beta
**Status:** SUPERSEDED by content rules approach (see above)

**Rationale:**
- Text posts are sufficient for forum discussions (core use case)
- Image/video embeds require additional infrastructure (blob storage, processing)
- Article format can be handled with long-form text posts
- Microblog type is for Bluesky federation (not immediate priority)
- Simplicity accelerates alpha launch

**Updated Approach (2025-10-18):**
- Post structure determines "type" (not explicit enum)
- Communities use `contentRules` to restrict embed types
- AppView derives `embed_type` from post structure for filtering
- More flexible than rigid type system

---

### 2025-10-18: Include Downvotes with Community Controls
**Decision:** Support both upvotes and downvotes, with toggles to disable downvotes

**Rationale:**
- Downvotes provide valuable signal for content quality
- Some communities prefer upvote-only (toxic negativity concerns)
- Instance operators should have global control option
- Reddit/HN have proven downvotes work with good moderation

**Implementation:**
- Community-level: `allowDownvotes` boolean in community profile
- Instance-level: Environment variable `ALLOW_DOWNVOTES` (future)
- Downvote attempts on disabled communities return error
- Stats show 0 downvotes when disabled

---

### 2025-10-18: 24-Hour Edit Window (Hardcoded for Alpha)
**Decision:** Posts can be edited for 24 hours after creation

**Rationale:**
- Allows fixing typos and errors
- Prevents historical revisionism (can't change old posts)
- 24 hours balances flexibility with integrity
- Future: Community-configurable edit windows

**Future Enhancements:**
- Edit history tracking (show what changed)
- Community-specific edit windows (0-72 hours)
- Moderator override (edit any post)

---

### 2025-10-18: Comments Separate from Posts PRD
**Decision:** Comments get their own dedicated PRD

**Rationale:**
- Comments are complex enough to warrant separate planning
- Threaded replies, vote inheritance, moderation all need design
- Posts are usable without comments (voting, tagging still work)
- Allows shipping posts sooner

**Scope Boundary:**
- **Posts PRD:** Post CRUD, voting, tagging, search
- **Comments PRD:** Comment threads, reply depth, sorting, moderation

---

### 2025-10-18: Feeds Separate from Posts PRD
**Decision:** Feed generation gets its own PRD

**Rationale:**
- Feed algorithms are complex (ranking, personalization, filtering)
- Posts need to exist before feeds can be built
- Feed work includes: Home feed, Community feed, All feed, read state tracking
- Allows iterating on feed algorithms independently

**Scope Boundary:**
- **Posts PRD:** Post creation, indexing, retrieval
- **Feeds PRD:** Feed generation, ranking algorithms, read state, personalization

## Lexicon Summary

### `social.coves.community.post.record`
**Status:** ✅ Defined, implementation TODO
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18 (removed `postType` enum)

**Required Fields:**
- `community` - DID of community (owner of repository)
- `createdAt` - Timestamp

**Optional Fields:**
- `title` - Post title (300 graphemes / 3000 bytes)

- `location` - Geographic coordinates
- `crosspostOf` - AT-URI of original post
- `crosspostChain` - Array of crosspost URIs

**Notes:**
- Author DID is inferred from the creation context (authenticated user), not stored in record
- Post "type" is derived from structure (has embed? what embed type? has title? text length?)
- Community's `contentRules` validate post structure at creation time

### `social.coves.community.post.create` (Procedure)
